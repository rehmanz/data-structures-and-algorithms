##
# Task 0
##
- O(n) or linear time to build the texts and calls lists
- O(1) or contant time to fetch first and last record


##
# Task 1
##
- O(n) or linear time to build the texts and calls lists
- O(n) for building the unique number of phone numbers

##
# Task 2
##
- O(n) or linear time to build the texts and calls lists
- O(n) for iterating through all records and finding the call with max time

##
# Task 3
##
- O(n) or linear time to build the texts and calls lists
- Part A
    - O(n) to build the local calls list
    - O(n log n) for sorting list (per https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)
    - Cumulative: O(n) + O(n log n) = O(n log n)
- Part B
    - O(n) to iterate through the calls list for % of calls calculation

##
# Task 4
##
- O(n) or linear time to build the texts and calls lists
- O(n^2) to iterate through call_outgoing list and individual incoming calls and text lists
- O(n log n) to sort
- Cumulative: O(n^2) + O(n log n) = O(n^2) i.e. Quadratic
